## Bubble Sort
> Repetitive algorithim that works by swapping elements. The elements are compared according to a certain criteria.Criteria may include If its greater or less than.

## What is Bubble Sort ? 
It is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case time complexity is quite high.

## Time Complexity 
1. Best-Case - O(n)
2. Average-Case - O(n^2)
3. Worst-Case -  O(n^2)
